The word `yet` is often used in questions to ask if something that is expected has happened. It implies that the action or event is anticipated but hasn't occurred up to this point. For example:

- `Have you finished your homework yet?` (You expect the homework to be finished soon, if not already)
- `Has the movie started yet?` (You expect the movie to start soon, if it hasn't already)
